SELF-REFLECTION:
The prospect of designing an operable code from scratch was somewhat intimidating, especially after taking a fairly long break from coding. However, I found that pseudocode genuinely helped me piece together exactly what I wanted each segment of code to do, making the actual code writing much simpler than if I were to jump in and start coding. I admittedly had the guidance of the project assignment to keep myself on track and remind me of some necessary elements, but I am nonetheless happy with the result! This was a fun project that has me looking forward to future javascript activities.
